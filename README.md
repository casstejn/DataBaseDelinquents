To run the eclipse project, select "import project" from the Eclipse->File menu, and select general->existing project. Browse to the project file located in your cloned git repo, and then hit finish in the eclipse window. Next, right click on the imported project and hit properties (very bottom). Select the libraries tab in the Java Build Path window and hit "Add Jars" button. This will take you to the eclipse project navigator window, and select the imported project and one of its JARS. After adding it, you will have to delete the JAR of the same name that has the path from Jon's personal machine. After all the JARS are added, then the program will run.
